# Athlete-Traking
This repository contains the initial version of an athlete tracking system that I developed as part of my project. The first version of the code uses the MobileNet SSD model, which is a lightweight deep learning model designed for real-time object detection. The model was pre-trained on the COCO dataset, which includes 80 different object classes, including "person" (class_id = 15). The initial implementation focuses on detecting a person in the frame, calculating their center, and providing basic feedback on their position relative to the center of the frame.

I am currently working on an enhanced version of this project that leverages more advanced pose estimation models. The new implementation uses either the MPI (15 points) or COCO (18 points) models for human pose estimation. These models allow for more detailed tracking of an athlete's body parts, such as limbs and joints, which can be used to analyze posture, movement, and other biomechanical metrics. This approach provides more precise tracking of body parts, enabling better analysis of an athlete's movements such as insights into angles, posture, and alignment, which are crucial for performance optimization and injury prevention.
